This is an api wrapper on top of a [DOS Server](https://github.com/ekeilty17/GA4GH-DOS-Server), whose goal is to be more inuitive while still conforming to the GA4GH standard api. The topology of the api can be found in a swaggerhub specification [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/ekeilty/Collections/1.0.0#/).
